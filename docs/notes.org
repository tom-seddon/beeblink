#+STARTUP: overview
* Random notes

Brain dump that's on GitHub so I have a backup.

* =--serial-test-XXX=

Send sequences of bytes from PC to BBC and vice versa, to check that
the underlying link is basically working. The tests run forever, and
the receiving end will crap out with an error if it receives something
unexpected.

Find the BBC files in the =beeblink= volume.

** PC to BBC

1. Quit server if it's already running

2. Run =T.PC-TO-BBC= on the Beeb

3. Run server with =--serial-test-pc-to-bbc= when requested

** BBC to PC

1. Quit server if it's already running

2. Run =T.BBC-TO-PC= on the Beeb

3. Run server with =--serial-test-bbc-to-pc=

4. Press any key on the BBC when requested

* Volume types

** DFS

For compatibility with DFS software - but with longer names and no
file limit.

File name format: =#.########=

Hierarchy: no

** ADFS
   
For compatibility with ADFS software or ADFS disk images.

File name format: =########=

Hierarchy: yes

Path separator: =.=

Parent dir: =^=

** PC

File name format: =*=

Hierarchy: yes

Path separator: =/= or =\= (

Parent dir: =..=

Unusual behaviour:

- file name character set is ASCII 33-126 (note that U+00A3 POUND SIGN
  is not permitted). All characters are just passed through and it's
  up to the PC filing system to complain

- only files with names <=20 (TBC) chars are supported. This is mostly
  so that it's feasible to print something useful in Mode 7 for =*CAT=
  or =*INFO=, but you probably don't want 21+ char names anyway...

- limited support for OSGBPB A=5, A=6, A=7 or A=8 (don't want to have
  to think about issues with file name length)

- PC volumes do not contain drives

- files in PC volumes never have BBC-style metadata - load/exec
  addresses always read as $ffffffff (producing =Won't= error as
  appropriate). Attributes reflect the attributes on the PC filing
  system

- files matching =*.txt= are interpreted as text, with newline
  normalization translation

* Speed tests

Back-of-the-envelope calculations to give peak plausible-ish throughput, for actual code that might actually run from a ROM.

BBC->server:

: lda (ptr),Y   ; +5 = 5   assume no page crossing
: sta via+0     ; +6 = 11
: lda #$10      ; +2 = 13
: -
: bit via+13    ; +6 = 19
: beq -         ; +2 = 21  assume branch not taken
: iny           ; +2 = 23

So 23N+3 for N unrolls, or 2e6/((23*N+3)/N). For 1 page:

1x = 75.12KBytes/sec
2x = 79.72KBytes/sec
4x = 82.24KBytes/sec
8x = 83.56KBytes/sec

Server->BBC:

: stx via+0     ; +6 = 6   arbitrary value to set the handshaking off
: lda #$10      ; +2 = 8
: -
: bit via+13    ; +6 = 14
: beq -         ; +2 = 16  assume branch not taken
: lda via+0     ; +6 = 22
: sta (ptr),Y   ; +6 = 28
: iny           ; +2 = 30

So 30N+3 for N unrolls, or 2e6/((30*N+3)/N). For 1 page:

1x = 59.19KBytes/sec
2x = 62.00KBytes/sec
4x = 63.52KBytes/sec
8x = 64.30KBytes/sec

Parasite throughput will be a bit faster in each case since there's no
need for indexing. But it's 10uS/byte so peak throughput is 100,000
bytes/sec.

** Base

as at 3d8d71fef08f9e7c457b5f600f50e98f09ba6fed:

SERVER: Host<->server: 116,736 bytes in 4 tests

** Parasite pagewise send tweak

There are obvious minor inefficiencies here.

Store VIA IFR mask in A, use BIT to test IFR, and X to store the byte.
Save 2 cycles each time.

** AVR USB_USBTask

Call USB_USBTsask a lot less often when waiting for BBC to become
ready. (Maintain a uint16_t counter. When it's 0 after incrementing,
call USB_USBTsask.)

Unroll 4x (no branch tweaks required):

Unroll 16x not reliably any quicker.

Conclusion: 2x = good.

** Tweak parasite stragglers recv loop

Make sure it's exactly 48 cycles in the fastest route through. Result
appears to be noise.

SERVER: Host<->server: 291,840 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 70.54 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 58.40 KBytes/sec
SERVER: Parasite<->server: 307,200 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 70.92 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 68.03 KBytes/sec

** Tweak parasite stragglers send loop

Ditto. Pretty sure this difference is just noise...

SERVER: Host<->server: 291,840 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 70.72 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 58.16 KBytes/sec

SERVER: Host<->server: 291,840 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 76.82 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 61.29 KBytes/sec

Conclusion: 4x = good

Hardly seems worth bothering with the straggler loops. There's no real
fat there.

** Parasite pairwise send

Before:

SERVER: Parasite<->server: 307,200 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 71.09 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 67.87 KBytes/sec

One pair per iteration:

SERVER: Parasite<->server: 309,750 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 62.63 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 69.06 KBytes/sec

Unroll 2x:

SERVER: Host<->server: 294,390 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 77.28 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 61.69 KBytes/sec
SERVER: Parasite<->server: 309,750 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 62.37 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 68.90 KBytes/sec

Not going to bother doing any more with this. The code is still there,
just toggled out.

* AVR code tweaks

Before (I think - reconstituted from the above):

SERVER: Host<->server: 294,390 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 77.28 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 61.69 KBytes/sec
SERVER: Parasite<->server: 307,200 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 71.09 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 67.87 KBytes/sec

Macroize various bits.

SERVER: Host<->server: 294,390 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 74.87 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 61.69 KBytes/sec
SERVER: Parasite<->server: 309,750 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 81.31 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 68.90 KBytes/sec

Macroize *everything*. Not sure this does much for the readability,
but it doesn't hurt the speed...

SERVER: Host<->server: 294,390 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 78.12 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 61.96 KBytes/sec
SERVER: Parasite<->server: 309,750 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 84.26 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 69.22 KBytes/sec

Rough figures:

Host send = 2000000/(78.12*1024) = 25 cycles/bytes
Host recv = 2000000/(61.96*1024) = 31.5 cycles/byte
Parasite send = 2000000/(84.26*1024) = 23.2 cycles/byte
Parasite recv = 2000000/(69.22*1024) = 28.2 cycles/byte

Since the host recv case hardly improved due to the AVR code tweaks,
the limit is presumably the 6502 code in that case. (Not sure there's
a vast amount to be squeezed out there, but, maybe...)

The host send/recv cases are now the 6.5 cycles apart you'd expect.
Recv is always going to be ~6-7 cycles slower, because there's an
extra 1MHz read, and the (zp),Y write always takes 6 cycles
(*SPEEDTEST transfers page-aligned data so the send case never hits
the page boundary crossin when reading).

The fact parasite recv is only 5 cycles slower than send is a bit
suspicious. Is there a bit more to be squeezed out here?

Add fast path for non-verbose large transfers:

SERVER: Host<->server: 294,390 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 78.55 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 61.83 KBytes/sec
SERVER: Parasite<->server: 309,750 bytes in 10 tests
SERVER:   Send: 85.69 KBytes/sec
SERVER:   Recv: 69.06 KBytes/sec

2000000/(85.69*1024) = 22.8 cycles/byte

Going to keep this change anyway, because it's the right thing to do,
even if it doesn't make much of a difference...
* Boot notes

Private workspace claim (request type 2) happens early on in the boot
process, and it isn't claimed - so it's a good place to reset the
link-started flag.

ROM boot (request type 3) can be claimed, so there's no guarantee the
BLFS ROM will receive it.

** Joystick port

Joystick/mouse port is I/O - you get some of the user port pins. Looks
like UPURS might be feasible.

Objections:

- No PB7, so can't check status with BMI
- Might be a bit flaky, as surely games will fiddle around with this
  all the time?
- If you don't play games, it's a bit rude to steal the mouse port

  # Disk images

  Use `*READ` to create a disk image from a disk, and `*WRITE` to write
  a disk image to a disk. The syntax for both is similar: specify file,
  drive (the 'other' drive will be deduced automatically when
  necessary), and disk image type.

  ,**Both operations use I/O processor memory from OSHWM onwards!**

  The following single-density types are supported, including truncated
  files. This two options cover the vast majority of BBC disk images
  available.

  ,* `S`/`S*`: .ssd, single-sided DFS
  ,* `D`/`D*`: .dsd, double-sided DFS

  Use `S`/`D` to read/write only the areas occupied by files (much
  quicker when the disk isn't full!), or `S*`/`D*` to read/write the
  whole disk.

  The following double-density types are supported, if the filing
  systems are available:

  ,* `A`/`A*`: ADFS S (160 KB)/M (320 KB)/L (640 KB)
  ,* `SO`/`SO*`: single-sided Opus DDOS/Challenger, 40T (180 KB)/80 T (360 KB)
  ,* `DO`/`DO*`: double-sided Opus DDOS/Challenger, 40T (360 KB)/80 T (720 KB)

  Again, `*` means to read/write the whole disk - otherwise, only
  occupied areas are transferred.

  Truncated double-density images are not supported!

  Notes:

  - protected disks are not supported

  - for `*WRITE`, the target disk must be formatted and of the
    appropriate capacity. There are some checks, but they aren't super
    thorough

  - `*READ` will retry indefinitely in the event of a disk error. If
    this means it just ends up getting stuck, hit ESCAPE to cancel

  - when using Opus DDOS/Challenger, do a `*CAT` of the disk before
    embarking on a `*READ`/`*WRITE`, so that the Opus FS can auto-detect
    the density. You may get spurious disk fault errors otherwise (this
    is a BeebLink bug: https://github.com/tom-seddon/beeblink/issues/42)
  
  - the `*` suffix is actually currently meaningless with the Opus
    DDOS/Challenger disk image types, and the whole disk is always read
    or written
  
  - when using `*READ`, you're creating a BBC file, so it will have a
    BBC-style file name and may well end up needing renaming

Ext Tube parasite<->server regression! - pretty much matches the
expected degradation from going from 20 cycles/byte to 21 cycles/byte,
plus a tiny bit of noise due to the $406 calls.
