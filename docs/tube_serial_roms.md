# Tube Serial ROMs

There are four Tube Serial ROM images, two for the BBC B/B+/Master and
two for the Electron.

The safe versions should be compatible with the widest range of
systems, but saving will be ~2/3 the speed of loading; the non-safe
versions, if they work, should show similar throughput for both
loading and saving.

(The Tube Serial max throughput is excellent, and 2/3 of that speed is
still extremely good. Whatever happens, you won't be disappointed, not
even if you're saving files on an Electron in mode 0.)

## `beeblink_tube_serial_safe.rom`

Compatible with BBC B/B+/Master.

## `beeblink_tube_serial.rom`

Compatible with BBC B+/Master.

May be compatible with BBC B - but not guaranteed! (For whatever it's
worth, it does work with my own BBC B.)

## `beeblink_tube_serial_safe_electron.rom`

Compatible with Electron+Plus 1+AP5.

## `beeblink_tube_serial_electron.rom`

May be compatible with Electron+Plus 1+AP5. At your own risk... it
doesn't work on my own Electron :(
